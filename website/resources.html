              What is Panvala and what problem does it solve?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Panvala is a donor-driven platform that helps fund the work that the whole Ethereum community depends on. Countless projects and people depend upon the Ethereum blockchain for their success. Problems like security and scalability span the entire ecosystem, but until Panvala there weren’t reliable business models to solve these problems that will affect millions (and even billions) of people’s lives.
              <br>
              <br>
              Contributing donations to Panvala rewards the teams who solve those problems by making grants available in a smart contract that we call the “token capacitor.” The funds in that smart contract are issued to grant recipients each quarter based on the votes of token holders. Structuring things in this way maximizes the value of donations by leveraging crowd-sourced, incentivized wisdom.
            </p>
            <li class="mb2 f5 mt3">
              Why do people donate to Panvala?</li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Our donors are a diverse group of individuals and businesses contributing funds for a variety of purposes. Some of them donate because they believe that all of Ethereum will either fail or succeed together, and they believe that their own success in using Ethereum depends upon this development.
              <br>
              <br>
              Other donors are attracted to the powerful status that comes with being a Panvala donor, including the marketing and recruiting opportunities that it affords our business sponsors. We offer in-app advertising solutions for sponsoring businesses, and we organize our community to support these businesses with their active loyalty.
              <br>
              <br>
              Lastly, our donors choose Panvala as the best place to contribute their funds over other avenues because they know that the broad crowd-sourced wisdom of the Panvala community will ensure that their funds are going to the most important work. Panvala brings a new layer of accountability and transparency to grants that just isn’t possible in centralized institutions.

              How does the Panvala platform work? What is slate governance?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Slate governance is the basic structure of the Panvala platform. A slate is a list of proposals that have been curated by an individual or a team on the platform. The slate’s recommender curates this list, explains their reasoning and thinking behind the recommendations, and organizes the broader Panvala community to support the slate that they have recommended. A ballot occurs each quarter if there are multiple competing slates available. Panvala’s token holders vote using their tokens to decide which slate will be accepted. One slate is adopted per category, per quarter. There are currently two different categories of slates planned for our short-term roadmap:
            </p>
              <ul class="f7 lh-text">
                <li>Grant proposal slates used to determine which teams should receive funding in a quarter</li>
                <li>Governance slates used to modify the parameters of how Panvala functions</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
                We believe the system will also grow over time and that new slate categories may be added to the system.
              </p>
            <li class="mb2 f5 mt3">
              What is the PAN token used for?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Slate recommenders do so for a number of reasons. Typically, a slate recommender may propose a grant for their own work in evaluating proposals on the platform. The slate recommender is incentivized not to make this amount too high, else they risk their slate failing due to this unreasonable request.
              <br>
              <br>
              Other incentives for slate recommenders also exist. Slate recommenders play a critical role in crafting the future direction of Ethereum. They garner respect and status for the important work that they do, and their work has a fulfilling and lasting impact on the whole Ethereum ecosystem.
            </p>
            <li class="mb2 f5 mt3">
              What happens to the tokens staked on slates that did not pass?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Those tokens are automatically donated to the token capacitor and become available to teams in the form of future grants.
            </p>
            <li class="mb2 f5 mt3">
              Does voting with tokens mean that those tokens are spent or lost after the vote?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              No. All tokens used for voting can be withdrawn to the token holder’s wallet after the ballot concludes. Users will receive a notification in the app’s notification panel when their tokens are available to be withdrawn.
            </p>

              What work has Panvala previously funded?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              So far, there have been two rounds of token grants resulting in 19 grants being awarded. You can view the work and the specific recipients of the first and second grant applications in our blog.

              Why does Panvala have its own PAN token? Why not just use ETH?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Using property rights to organize cooperation makes it easy for people to do work and get rewarded for it without needing anyone’s approval to do so. As a result, people capable of improving property can identify themselves without needing to be recognized by a central planner. We’re familiar with how these plays out with land or intellectual property, and these same dynamics can be harnessed to organize the provision of public goods.
              <br>
              <br>
              A normal foundation hires donor development staff to increase the flow of donations into the organization. Instead of having a handful of donor development employees who get rewarded for increasing donations, Panvala can have thousands or even millions of token holders who can be rewarded for increasing donations. The more donations there are, the more demand there is for the tokens they hold, so token holders have an incentive to tap their social networks to recruit more donors to fund the work we all care about.
              <br>
              <br>
              Since we can’t change the rules of ETH to work in this way (nor would we want to), Panvala uses its own token.
            </p>
            <li class="mb2 f5 mt3">
              What is the purpose of staking on the Panvala platform?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              Tokens are staked in order for a slate to appear on the platform’s ballot. This prevents spam and poorly conceived recommendations that are unlikely to pass from being added to the ballot, while raising the overall quality of proposals on the platform.

              What is possible in your current alpha? What functionality will be available at launch?
            </li>
            <p class="ma0 f7 lh-text">
              The current alpha build allows our testers to create grant proposals, add these proposals to slates of recommendations, and participate in ranked choice voting using test tokens to which grant proposals should be funded. Users also receive in-app notifications based on their MetaMask wallet. Test tokens can also be staked to add a slate to the ballot. Tokens can also be withdrawn successfully after voting.
              <br>
              <br>
              Among many other features, our mainnet launch will include a user journey for purchasing and donating PAN tokens, it will include more advanced logic around voting periods, improvements to the process of submitting a proposal and building a slate, and give full control over the system to token holders by allowing the creation of governance proposal slates, with full governance parameters.

              Not at this time, but we are interested in partnering with existing a 501(c)3 that would be interested in making donations to Panvala a part of their charitable work. If you are part of such a non-profit organization and would like to help facilitate these donations, please get in touch with us at

              If you need 501(c)3 status to make a donation, please let us know so that we can explore the options with you.
