## [1.0.0]

This release includes contract changes in response to audit findings, as well as frontend and API changes for compatibility with these contract changes.

The most significant system change is that the first week of the epoch is now a "quiet period" during which no slates can be created. This allows end-of-epoch business such as finalizing contests and executing proposals to happen at a defined time, and for slate creators to have a clearer sense of the state of the system when creating their slates.

In addition, the system is now live on mainnet, with contracts at the following addresses:
- Gatekeeper: [0x21C3FAc9b5bF2738909C32ce8e086C2A5e6F5711](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21C3FAc9b5bF2738909C32ce8e086C2A5e6F5711)
- ParameterStore: [0x6a43334331dc689318Af551b0CFD624a8B11A70B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6a43334331dc689318Af551b0CFD624a8B11A70B)
- TokenCapacitor: [0x9a7B675619d3633304134155c6c976E9b4c1cfB3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a7B675619d3633304134155c6c976E9b4c1cfB3)
- Token (PAN): [0xD56daC73A4d6766464b38ec6D91eB45Ce7457c44](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD56daC73A4d6766464b38ec6D91eB45Ce7457c44)

### Added
- Add support for multiple resources (currently grant and governance)
  - Display grant and governance slates on the `/slates` view
  - Add support for voting on multiple resources at once
    - Store the resource along with vote choices
    - Fix calculation of signature on API
  - Add `/slates/create` route with drop-down to choose the type of slate to create
  - Save the mapping of `Proposal` to `Request` for each resource in the database to make it possible to execute the proposals
- Cache IPFS data in the database for faster access
- Enable "Back" buttons throughout the frontend
- There's a new [panvala.com](https://panvala.com), with its code in the repository
- A new `TimeTraveler` component makes it easier to adjust the current period and epoch in development
- There are now several admin scripts for manipulating the system and checking its status
  - `reveal.js` - reveal ballots stored in the database
  - `setValue.js` - execute governance proposals
  - `finalize.js` - finalize all contests in an epoch
  - `contract-info.js` - print information about the deployed mainnet contracts
  - `epoch-timing.js` - print epoch schedule for many epochs
  - `nukedb.js` - delete database tables
- Add `PANVALA_ENV` environment variable
- Add `/liveness` route to frontend

### Changed
- Many styling improvements in the frontend
- Adjusted liveness and readiness probe parameters to reduce the number of pings
- Indicators for pending transactions and other operations are much improved. They are displayed in more cases, and the stepper shows the number of transactions that will be sent.
- When creating a grant slate, the user can see an estimate of the number of tokens available
- Split slates view into "current" and "past"
- New and improved utilities for timing and voting
- Improved `time-travel.js` script
- Updated token address, name, and symbol. It is now `Panvala pan (PAN)`.
- Updated initial unlocked balance for token capacitor
- Split API tests into separate files

Contract changes (they deserve their own section)

- Initialization
  - Make it harder to do anything before the system is ready
    - Block getters for an uninitialized `ParameterStore` and add a public `initialized` getter
    - Pass the `Gatekeeper` address as an argument to the `TokenCapacitor`
    - Revert in `ParameterStore.init()` if the `gatekeeperAddress` parameter is not set
  - Do not allow the following actions when the gatekeeper is not current:
    - `requestPermission()`
    - `recommendSlate()`
    - `stakeTokens()`
    - `depositVoteTokens()`
    - `finalizeContest()`
- Slate creation
  - Disallow creation of requests in the Gatekeeper outside of the slate submission period
  - Do not allow slates to be created with old requests (from a previous epoch)
- TokenCapacitor balance unlocking
  - Fix bug where someone could cause tokens never to be unlocked by repeatedly calling updateBalances() before 24 hours had passed
  - Set the lastLockedTime in intervals of 24 hours, relative to the system start
- Finalization
  - Only allow finalization after the epoch is over
  - Add a quiet period before slate submission period (for finalization)
  - Do not explicitly reject slates -- remove `SlateStatus.Rejected`
  - Keep a running tally of voting results as users reveal, so that finalization can happen in a single step. This removes the public `finalizeRunoff()` and `ContestStatus.RunoffPending`.
  - Incrementally donate slate stakes
- Other contract improvements
  - Rename `tokenCapacitorAddress` parameter to `stakeDonationAddress` and add a generic `IDonationReceiver` interface to define contracts that implement the `donate()` function.
  - Pin Solidity version
  - Replace mappings with arrays
  - Make `TokenCapacitor.scale` constant
  - Added various checks on user input
  - Some refactoring for efficiency


## [0.5.0] 2019-07-09

### Added
- Users can assign an address as a delegate to commit ballots on behalf of a token-holding account at `/wallet`

  - Store the incumbent for each resource
  - Users can create proposals to change governance parameters
  - Token capacitor releases tokens into the unlocked pool for withdrawal according to an exponential decay
  - Requests made to the gatekeeper expire after an epoch (if created in epoch `n`, they expire at the start of epoch `n + 2`)

- Only recommenders that have been verified have their organization name shown on slate cards
- Improve loading of the initial slate
  - Decouple unrelated sets of state
  - Allow users to view the slates without having MetaMask installed
